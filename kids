1. Mathematics in Medical Devices

Mathematics is the "language" of medical device design — from the first concept to performance verification.

Area	Application Examples

Signal Processing:-	ECG, EEG, and ultrasound devices use Fourier transforms, filtering, and statistical modeling to clean up and interpret sensor signals.
Calibration & Control Systems:-	Infusion pumps calculate drug delivery rates using differential equations to ensure precise dosage.
Imaging Algorithms:- 	CT, MRI, PET rely on matrix algebra, tomographic reconstruction (Radon transforms), and 3D interpolation.
Error & Risk Analysis:- 	Blood glucose meters use error propagation formulas and probabilistic models to ensure accuracy.
Optimization:-	Prosthetic limb design uses optimization algorithms to minimize weight while maintaining strength.

2. Physics in Medical Devices

Physics translates medical needs into measurable, physical phenomena that devices can use.

Physics Branch 	How It’s Used

Electromagnetism:- 	MRI uses nuclear magnetic resonance; pacemakers use electric fields to stimulate heart muscles.
Acoustics:- 	Ultrasound imaging works via sound wave propagation and Doppler effects.
Optics	:- Endoscopes and pulse oximeters rely on light absorption, scattering, and reflection principles.
Thermodynamics	:- Cryosurgery tools use heat transfer equations; incubators regulate temperature based on thermal dynamics.
Radiation :- Physics	X-ray machines use photon-matter interaction models to produce diagnostic images.

3. Mechanics in Medical Devices

Mechanics ensures the device can physically interact with the human body reliably and safely.

Mechanics Area	Medical Device Applications

Statics & Dynamics:- 	Orthopedic implants must withstand load distribution and patient movement forces.
Fluid Mechanics:- 	Ventilators and dialysis machines rely on laminar/turbulent flow models for blood, air, or medication delivery.
Biomechanics	:- Prosthetic joints mimic torque, leverage, and stress distribution in human joints.
Vibration Analysis:- 	Dental drills and surgical tools are tuned to resonance frequencies for precision.
Material Mechanics	:- Catheters, stents, and surgical instruments need stress-strain analysis to avoid breakage inside the body.
