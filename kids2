⚙️ 1. Mechanics

Bed Positioning & Actuators:
Hospital beds have linear actuators, hydraulic or electric motors to adjust height, tilt (Trendelenburg/reverse), backrest, and leg support. Mechanics ensures:

Correct force & torque transmission.

Smooth motion without jerks (important for patients with injuries).

Proper linkage design (levers, gears, hinges).


Load Bearing:
Beds must safely support hundreds of kilograms. Mechanical engineering ensures:

Frame strength (stress/strain analysis).

Fatigue life (repeated up/down movements).

Stability (bed won’t tip over when tilted or raised).


Safety Locks & Brakes:
Wheel brakes and side rail locking involve friction, force, and material strength.

📐 2. Mathematics

Control Algorithms:
The bed uses embedded controllers for motors, sensors, and alarms. Mathematics helps in:

Position control (PID controllers, kinematics).

Calculating angle/height adjustments.

Detecting abnormal loads or motor stalls.


Optimization:
Efficient design for power usage, noise reduction, and smooth motion needs math-based modeling.

Data Processing:
Some Hillrom beds integrate with monitoring systems → math is used in signal filtering, data interpolation, and trend analysis (e.g., patient movement, weight monitoring).

🧪 3. Physics

Forces & Motion:
Newton’s laws explain:

How much force is needed to lift the patient safely.

Why counterweights or damping are used for balance.


Friction & Damping:
To prevent sudden drops or uncontrolled movement, beds use dampers/springs, designed using physics of motion.

Electrical Systems:
Electric motors, actuators, sensors (load cells, pressure sensors) rely on electromagnetism.

Pressure Distribution:
Special surfaces prevent bedsores/pressure ulcers. This involves physics of pressure = force/area and material science (foam, air cells).

Ergonomics & Human Physics:
Ensuring natural spinal alignment, safe patient transfers, and minimizing caregiver strain uses biomechanics.

📐 Mathematics

Weight Measurement System:
Beds often have load cells under the frame.

Uses equations like:

W = F = m \cdot g

Signal processing filters out noise from patient movement.

Control Systems:
PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) control adjusts actuators for smooth height/tilt changes.

Angle & Geometry:
Trigonometry calculates bed tilt (Trendelenburg, Fowler position).

Optimization:
Power usage, actuator efficiency, and motor duty cycles require numerical optimization.

🧪 Physics

Forces & Torque:

Actuators must lift patient + mattress + bed structure safely.

Torque = Force × Lever arm length → used to size motors/gears.


Friction & Brakes:
Wheels use static friction for locking and kinetic friction to prevent sliding.

Electrical Physics:

Motors use electromagnetism.

Sensors (strain gauges, Hall sensors, encoders) rely on physical effects.


Pressure Distribution:

Mattresses are designed using fluid dynamics & pressure = force/area to reduce bedsores.

Air-flow mattress uses Bernoulli’s principle for circulation.


Energy & Power:
Battery backup uses power equations (P = V × I) to ensure critical operation during outages.

⚙️ Mechanics

Linkages & Levers:
Beds convert motor linear motion into rotation for backrest/leg support via linkages.

Structural Strength:
Frame is designed using stress–strain mechanics to support heavy patients (>250 kg).

Quick Release (CPR function):
A spring-loaded mechanism drops the bed flat instantly → requires precise mechanical energy storage and release.

Wheels & Casters:
Use bearing mechanics to reduce rolling resistance and make maneuvering easier.

🔌 Electronics & Embedded Systems

Motors & Actuators: DC motors, stepper motors, or linear actuators controlled by H-bridges.

Sensors:

Load cells → weight monitoring.

Encoders → bed angle & actuator position.

Pressure sensors → detect patient exit/fall.


Communication: Many beds connect via nurse call systems, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, CAN bus, RS-485.

Safety Circuits: Current sensors detect stalls → stop motor to prevent injury.

🖥️ Control & Software

Microcontroller / RTOS manages:

Motor control.

Sensor data fusion (weight, position, pressure).

Alarm systems (bed exit, power failure).


State Machines: Define bed operating modes (raise head, lower bed, CPR, Trendelenburg).

Smart Integration: Beds connect to hospital information systems → send alerts if patient at risk.

🏗️ Material Science

Frame: Steel alloys for strength + powder coating for hygiene.

Mattress: Memory foam, air cells, gel materials designed for elasticity, damping, and antimicrobial surfaces.

Casters/Wheels: Polymer + rubber compounds for low noise & durability.

🧍 Human Factors (Biomechanics & Ergonomics)

Patient Safety: Bed height adjusted for fall risk.

Caregiver Ergonomics: Adjustable height reduces nurse back strain.

Mobility Assistance: Some beds tilt to help patients stand up → requires biomechanics of gait.
